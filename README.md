The JS programmer for BotProtocol

Alfred is the UI and code editor where scripts can be created and executed.

Any IoT node running the [BotProtocol](https://github.com/homebots/bot-protocol) can receive instructions.

`alfred` talks to a [server](ws://hub.homebots.io/) that in turns relays all messages to 
IoT devices running [Betty](https://github.com/homebots/betty).
